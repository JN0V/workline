# Backlog

## Next, in order

The committer and the documentalist first: two roles that prove their worth on
this repository before any other role is added.

1. **Evaluation, the judge.** The evaluation keeps the exact model, effort and
   tokens of each score, compares models (`WORKLINE_EVAL=claude:<model>@<effort>`),
   summarises the runs (`go run ./tests/evaluation/summary`) and runs every
   week (tests/evaluation/schedule/, docs/spec/conformance.md); models follow
   the aliases and a change is noticed (ADR-0004); tiers were set on its
   measures (the documentalist condenses on `frontier`); a `judge` check asks
   what no check can grade of an agent `WORKLINE_JUDGE` names, never of the
   graded one's provider, and any command can be that agent (`cmd:`). The judge
   takes the best independence available and says which (ADR-0005); the
   weekly run judges on `claude:sonnet`. Left: a judge of another provider,
   when there is one. Each defect a role lets through becomes a case.
2. **Finish the documentalist**, before any other role. Tried on another
   machine (2026-09-28), two gaps:
   - **An install that sets everything up**, interactive and run again to
     reconfigure: it asks what to enable (the global hooks, the agent, the
     roles run on this machine), installs or names the tools each role uses
     (gitleaks, lychee, the claude CLI, from the roles' `uses`), installs the
     hooks, and ends with a `workline doctor` that says what is missing and
     the command that installs it (as `flutter doctor`, `brew doctor`). Today
     the README's install lists neither tool, and gitleaks' warning
     (`secrets-not-checked`) gives no command.
   - **Adoption in a repository**: on another repository the documentalist
     most likely never ran — `pre-push` is not routed by default, no doc
     declares `sources`, so none is tracked, and its findings stay quiet
     before a push. A `workline init` that routes `pre-push` and, with an
     agent, proposes each doc's `sources` for a person to confirm; `doctor`
     says, for the repository, whether the documentalist runs and how many
     docs it tracks.

Then, once both work well here:

- **Release manager, merge-request flow** — a release MR kept up to date, the
  tag on merge; the natural flow in a team.
- **Publishing** — tagged, signed binaries, so CI installs a pinned version;
  the repository is public, so `go install` works, but the templates still
  follow `main`.
- **More agents** — Codex, Antigravity, OpenCode adapters (any command already
  runs as `cmd:`, prompt in, proposals out); `independent-of` in the engine;
  generate the model grid from models.dev and Epoch (docs/spec/model-grid.md).
- **Next roles** — reviewer, architect, tester. The reviewer does not wait for
  another provider: it takes the best independence available and says which
  (ADR-0005). Among its first rules: a comment says why the code is there,
  readable in five years without the bug; the bug's story belongs in the
  commit message. The mechanical part (long comment blocks added, ticket
  codes, "used to", "the bug was") before any AI.
- **Which model reviews which.** Evaluation cases with defects planted on
  purpose — a wrong edge case, a comment telling a bug's story — reviewed by
  Opus, Sonnet and Haiku, at each independence level of ADR-0005: what each
  one catches, and at what cost. Before the reviewer is built.

## Parked

Topics raised and parked, so they are not lost; removed once done. Newest
last.

### Roles and method

- **Consolidate the test corpus.** Tests should prove behaviour over time, not
  the one fix just made. Before adding a test, look for one covering the same
  behaviour and extend it; periodically merge redundant tests, using coverage
  overlap and mutation score. A tester or test-curator role.
- **Five whys as a shared skill.** Root cause before any countermeasure in the
  defect ledger; used by reviewer, developer, tester, architect; triggered when
  a defect is recorded or a role blocks repeatedly.
- **Context and memory management.** Long agent sessions fill their context and
  degrade (compaction, context rot). Make My Dreams addressed it; decide whether
  the framework handles it, e.g. what a role writes down for the next run
  instead of keeping it in context.
- **Rebuild Make My Dreams on this framework**, once it works.
- **Style (vale).** Parked 2026-09-28: without AI, the risk for a doc is to
  be wrong or out of reach, which the checks already cover; a style linter
  adds a binary, rules to keep and findings people learn to ignore. Worth it
  when a project already keeps a vale config: run vale when `.vale.ini`
  exists, as lychee is run, and report without blocking.
- **Release notes must not claim what is not built.** The first trial release
  listed the documentalist as working, because its role *definition* was
  committed as `feat(documentalist): …`. A change that only specifies a role is
  `docs`, not `feat`; and the release manager's notes should be checked against
  what the code can actually do (the "capability lie" Make My Dreams detected).

### Engine and CI

- **Granularity of a task's scope.** The scope comes from the `ready` work item
  (routing spec). Still open: paths, modules or components, and how a module is
  declared.
- **Let a project raise a rule to block.** `enforce` only lowers a rule
  (block → warn → off); the documentalist's hygiene findings are reported and
  cannot be made to block.
- **Settings merge one level deep.** A project that sets
  `budgets: {doc-lines: 300}` drops the other budgets; the documentalist says
  so (`setting-missing`), but a deep merge would be less surprising.
- **An unknown option exits 2.** Go's option parser exits 2, which the exit
  codes reserve for `human`; the CLI should say 64, as for other misuse.
- **Your config folder on macOS.** `config.yaml` and the global hooks follow
  Go's config folder (`~/Library/Application Support/workline` on macOS), but
  your own facets are looked for in `~/.config/workline/roles/`: one folder
  for all, or both named in docs/usage.md.
